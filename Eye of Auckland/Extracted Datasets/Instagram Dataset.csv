,"#Warning: This story contains references to sexual violence, slavery and coercion that some viewers may find disturbing.  
 
Lucy* was 15 when a family friend raped her.  
 
“I never said anything because I was ashamed and scared,” she says, “I didn’t want anyone to think less of me.” 
 
The offender was 35. After months of raping her, he then sold Lucy to four men who paid $100 - $200 to have sex with her. 
 
Sunday’s Miriama Kamo spoke with Lucy, still a teenager, about this harrowing case of sex slavery. 
 
*Not her real name.

,"“Then at 8.30pm there was a massive wave and it went all the way up and over the coastal road ... 10m-15m inland.”

Lennox Goodhue-Wikitera has woken bleary-eyed this morning after a “scary” night on tsunami watch in the Far North.

Goodhue-Wikitera’s hometown Ahipara, west of Kaitāia, was among coastal areas put under alert by the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) after an earthquake north of New Zealand.

The 7.7 magnitude quake struck southeast of the Loyalty Islands just before 3pm yesterday, also triggering a tsunami threat for Vanuatu, Fiji and New Caledonia.

NEMA had warned the first tsunami activity could reach New Zealand’s shores by 5pm, around North Cape, saying it could bring unusual currents and unpredictable surges.

,"🇵🇰 Imran & Muhammad representing Pakistan.
In these photos, my 3-year-old son and l are both wearing the Shalwar Kameez and waistcoats. Shalwar Kameez is the national dress of Pakistan and worn by men, women, and children in all five provinces. Since 1982, all Government officials working in the Secretariat have been required to wear traditional clothing. Each Province has a unique way of wearing a Shalwar kameez. Pakistan is famous for the Sindhi Shalwar kameez, Punjabi Shalwar kameez, Balochi Shalwar kameez and Pashtun Shalwar kameez. The clothing has been influenced by years of old heritage. Clothing is the identity of any nation. The dress in each region reflects the climatic conditions, lifestyle and unique style that gives it a distinct identity in all cultures.

,"🇳🇺 Amazing representing Niue.
In Niue, our cultural clothing is super unique and stands out amongst many. What l am wearing is a ‘Lausi’, the vibrant green leaf wrapped around my waist and wrist is made from a beautiful exotic plant. The headpiece on my head is called a “foufou”, ladies and men wear this piece to functions or when performing. The necklace is called a “kahoa hihi"" a beautiful piece created from tiny yellow snail shells, it is often worn by women at celebrations, for example, weddings or during cultural performances.
Men also wear the kahoa hihi as part of their costume when performing. It is presented as a gift and holds significant value to the Niuean culture. The unique
patterns at the bottom of the dress and around the neck are called Hiapo patterns. My cultural clothes make me feel special. I love to represent my culture and share it with others around me.

,"A vote of no confidence in Gore District Mayor Ben Bell has failed after not getting any support around the council table at an extraordinary meeting this afternoon.

Neither did a motion calling for Bell's removal from all council committees.

RNZ revealed in March that Bell and Gore District Council chief executive Stephen Parry were no longer speaking, and only last month another councillor was appointed as a go-between for the two men.

Last Wednesday, deputy mayor Keith Hovell and councillor Richard McPhail asked for the 24-year-old to step down.

Bell described the days following the request for him to resign as some of the darkest in his life.

Bell refused and said he felt supported by the community since the request became public.

He told today's extraordinary council meeting the council desperately needed help to move forward.

Gore's deputy mayor Keith Hovell told the meeting he had witnessed bad behaviour over the past several months.

He did not provide specifics but said he had to call out bad behaviour when he saw it.

Hovell said the mental health of councillors and council staff was at stake.

,"RNZ is delighted to announce the appointment of Charlotte Cook as the new presenter for Midday Report - Te Pūrongo o te Poutūtanga on RNZ National and Susana Suisuiki the new host of Pacific Waves on RNZ Pacific.

Cook has most recently been a senior reporter/producer for Morning Report and hosted the programme over the summer, as well as filling-in on Midday Report.

Suisuiki joined RNZ Pacific as a journalist in early 2022 and has spent time on air as a fill-in newsreader and Pacific Waves host. She takes on the permanent presenter role following Koroi Hawkins’ move to the Pacific News Editor role at RNZ Pacific.

RNZ’s Head of News Richard Sutherland says Charlotte and Susana are great examples of the outstanding fresh talent at RNZ.",,"","0","1350","1080","https://scontent-bom1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347402273_897710967967075_5139210080382134296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=DcwJxjDGV-wAX9fv0p8&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBriakA_szkhubEJ6PdkR-UPwZf29jv5ZEmO8AEZjtiiQ&oe=647065F0&_nc_sid=62388f","","3104241571985197870",,,"CsUe0NDLYsu",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsUe0NDLYsu/",,,,,"","0","1350","1080","https://scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347431908_575478194692613_16513656234102330_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=jP3oVhasU6wAX8n2Kwd&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD1GvmEG0HjIMMWMjl3hSnnuClAVZLqwZCDoRJb5QvX7Q&oe=646F44A7&_nc_sid=62388f","","3104241571850919895",,,"CsUe0M7LJ_X",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsUe0M7LJ_X/",,,,,"","0","1350","1080","https://scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347420520_119547697803142_769788544715153686_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=kpdfLJtzhhoAX9YiWft&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBr1pHdxlkMDAPZgc-Z8Tp9H9hcn0EAF-1QyGXJOllzng&oe=6470D09E&_nc_sid=62388f","","3104241571355969470",,,"CsUe0MdrEe-",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsUe0MdrEe-/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"16","1350","1080","https://scontent-bom1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347402273_897710967967075_5139210080382134296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=DcwJxjDGV-wAX9fv0p8&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBriakA_szkhubEJ6PdkR-UPwZf29jv5ZEmO8AEZjtiiQ&oe=647065F0&_nc_sid=62388f","❤️ look",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3104241582311662275","https://scontent-bom1-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347402273_897710967967075_5139210080382134296_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=DcwJxjDGV-wAX9fv0p8&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBriakA_szkhubEJ6PdkR-UPwZf29jv5ZEmO8AEZjtiiQ&oe=647065F0&_nc_sid=62388f","https://scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347431908_575478194692613_16513656234102330_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=jP3oVhasU6wAX8n2Kwd&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD1GvmEG0HjIMMWMjl3hSnnuClAVZLqwZCDoRJb5QvX7Q&oe=646F44A7&_nc_sid=62388f","https://scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/347420520_119547697803142_769788544715153686_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-bom1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=kpdfLJtzhhoAX9YiWft&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBr1pHdxlkMDAPZgc-Z8Tp9H9hcn0EAF-1QyGXJOllzng&oe=6470D09E&_nc_sid=62388f",,,,,,,,"false","17984104712300753","0","rob.southern",,,,,,,,,,,,"❤️ look","2023-05-19T20:44:32.000Z","18052640644421009","0","pesioh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Love it Sana🌺❤️Love you God Bless🙏","2023-05-18T18:22:49.000Z","17968900280197186","0","lucy.xia.3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Congratulations🔥🔥","2023-05-17T07:14:26.000Z","17987572799009157","1","nlotesavea",,,,,,,,,,,"0","Ainnnng Yassss gurl @sanasuisuiki 😍 love to see it!","2023-05-17T07:03:34.000Z","17845134134990088","0","nilandart",,,,,,,,,,,"0","👏👏","2023-05-17T06:49:31.000Z","18275041795135454","1","faaitu_trisha",,,,,,,,,,,"0","Yassss girls!

,"🍊🍌💲 Food prices are rising the fastest they have since the introduction of GST in the late 1980s, well ahead of most other sectors. Fruit and veg are leading the way, up more than 22 percent in the past year.

A poll last year found overwhelming support for removing GST from fruit and vegetables. However, removing GST could make food cheaper for the rich, and introduce complexities to the tax system.

""It sounds very nice in principle, doesn't it?"" Lincoln University professor of agricultural economics Alan Renwick told Morning Report.

""At present, the tax ""falls on both producers and consumers, so even if all the cut was fed through, it wouldn't lead to a 15 percent fall in prices"".

And with just two major players, there would be no guarantee the supermarkets would pass on the savings either, he said.

""...That's a $3.5b hole in our government funding. Where's that money going to come from? If you ask [voters] 'shall we reduce the food tax and we will have less money to spend on schools, health, other factors as well', they may well have given a different answer.""

""New Zealand [has] a very simple tax system because everything pays GST, and that's much easier to administrate,"" Renwick said.

""When you begin to exempt certain goods and services, it becomes much more complex and that is a problem because then collecting the tax costs more, it becomes more inefficient and it can have side effects on that as well.""

""Some work has shown that if you collect the tax and then give a lump sum payment back to people, you will actually help lower-income households more than removing the tax.""",,"","0","1350","1080","https://instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/347099761_609741491121238_2465469816874292363_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=btHzuBTjxiEAX-T4iCr&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCnc_eGrybnYh9eawmfjpK70wuVilCY64oZL0uCA661gQ&oe=6471310D&_nc_sid=62388f","","3102756783587942627",,,"CsPNNsGMWDj",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPNNsGMWDj/",,,,,"","0","1350","1080","https://instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/346973460_1245290272765240_2713564233487242435_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=wKO6HaY8IKsAX8nu8Rd&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC62h4yXcDSeyXZwYx5SkW2cAmN-nAzNnYZ50qeSkq9zQ&oe=6470043B&_nc_sid=62388f","","3102756782765779509",,,"CsPNNrVMCo1",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPNNrVMCo1/",,,,,"","0","1350","1080","https://instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/346993787_254137753779144_4996642789231493548_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=WS7UvYE8RpkAX-ujwZ-&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDDtOn5vqxNGT3_nLbmuh8FmNEHcz9js_jkhl7D4sEWdg&oe=646FE657&_nc_sid=62388f","","3102756783009294592",,,"CsPNNrjs-kA",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPNNrjs-kA/",,,,,"","0","1350","1080","https://instagram.ftpe4-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/347416437_1030466617922515_4921591044751162623_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe4-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=YaP_2cpDWrIAX_WFQGb&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDdFUrMlUzLxvUea_y3LvlvQu_JdWxn-QVxMurNz3pzzw&oe=6470687B&_nc_sid=62388f","","3102756783319587609",,,"CsPNNr2MpsZ",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPNNr2MpsZ/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"36","1350","1080","https://instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/347099761_609741491121238_2465469816874292363_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftpe4-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=btHzuBTjxiEAX-T4iCr&edm=AABBvjUAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCnc_eGrybnYh9eawmfjpK70wuVilCY64oZL0uCA661gQ&oe=6471310D&_nc_sid=62388f","Tax the Rich!!!

Bridget Bell, a Manawatū District Councillor, says she has experienced derogatory comments that liken her to a child still wearing nappies. 

Ben Bell, New Zealand's youngest mayor at 24 years old, has also encountered comparable criticism in recent weeks.

,"The ice bath didn’t stress me. The breath-hold underwater with a weighted vest was fine. But there was one thing that wrecked me.

It was day one of the ‘Calm Under Pressure’ workshop in Piha, an elite mental skills and stress mitigation course. Twenty-three punters had ponied up $1350 to spend two days learning from Dave Wood, and I was along for the ride.

I took the course with the man known for being Israel Adesanya’s breathing and mind coach.

,"❤️ Happy Mother's Day Aucklanders.
To celebrate this special day, we look at Auckland Zoo's most recent mothers.
🔴 Cotton-top tamarin mum Mrs Nuri gave birth to twins – her 5th lot of twins since arriving in late 2017.
🔴 3 nyala calves were born a  week apart from one another.  Kidogo birthed Victoria, Johari birthed Panya and Jama birthed Binta.
ℹ️ If you'd like to find out more about the cotton-top tamarins and the nyala, visit @aucklandzoo

,"Bana representing Kurdistan.
The traditional Kurdish clothing symbolises the prominent Kurdish heritage and culture, with women’s Kurdish clothing consisting of extreme colour and style. Traditionally for women, a long dress is worn with a cropped vest or a long cardigan. The undergarments tend to match the colour of the dress and accessories are also worn such as gold chain belts. The traditional male clothing consists of faint earth-toned baggy pants, which are completed by a large belt or sash tied around the waist. As for the top half, plain shirts are worn with vests or jackets that match the colour of the pants. As for traditional headpieces, men tend to wrap a turban around their heads, but this has become uncommon due to modern shifts. Kurdish clothing differs from men to women, as well as from town to town. Usually, you can recognise which area a Kurd is from just by looking at their traditional Kurdish clothing. A beautiful aspect of the clothing is that it is worn daily by many people in Kurdistan. It is not only reserved for special occasions. Kurdish traditional clothing is an incredible way for many to maintain the love and expression for their cultural identity.

,"🇮🇷 Zahra & Parisa representing Iran.
These pictures demonstrate the traditional Gilani and Azari clothes. The most important part of women's local clothes in Gilan, is the vibrant scarves with colourful shirts, well-structured coats, beautiful skirts and pants. The most outstanding feature of Gilani women's clothing is their pleated skirts with horizontal coloured ribbons. The Azari people who live in the northwest of Iran have also designed beautiful traditional dresses for women with various unique patterns and decorations immersed in beautiful colours. Most of these clothes are made of cashmere, silk, and velvet fabrics. One of the most beautiful and distinguishing features of this dress is its sleeves, which are long and have different shapes at the end. Although the arrival of modernity in Iran in the 20th century overtook the traditional costumes and introduced a new dress code, at times you might see these beautiful clothes, especially at weddings or other ceremonies.

,"🇳🇵 Sanjeeta representing Nepal. 
“Kurta Suruwal” is the traditional costume worn by women in Nepal. It consists of super light baggy pants, a beautiful blouse, and a large scarf. This outfit is often used by Nepali females in modern days. The trousers are loose, mainly cotton and can come in a wide range of vibrant colours. Majority of the time they are solid-coloured without any patterns. Some modern suruwal might have prints and patterns as an embellishment. The blouse contains beautiful fine details, composed of unique colour combinations and prints. The scarf is large; it is worn draped over the body. The pattern on the scarf matches usually matches the one on the blouse.

,"🇸🇸 Gatluak representing South Sudan.
Lawa is a South Sudanese cultural dress worn by all genders. The rule of thumb is that men tie the knot on the right and women tie it on the left. Lawa is hand knitted, and the beads are hand-made. History is passed down from generation to generation in a tactile way. It is all about the human touch. The normal Lawa is not embroidered, it’s simply plain. The embroidered pieces are for special occasions and they involve dance. These occasions could be weddings, celebrations, harvest, peace, and any happy moment that has anything to do with dance. Beads come in many different designs. The tip of the long tail of the beads at the back is made of sheep's wool. The bead's tail at the back measures body movements. The best dancers are recognised through the movement of the beads on the tail. The hand bracelets reflect the South Sudanese flag and must match the flag on the beads worn in the front. It is not about the outfit but the details that go with it.

Police were not allowed to perform their job so the women were unable to hold their event due to violence directed at them. The women escaped via marshals and private security through a rabid hostile crowd demeaning them, throwing signs & more liquids at them.

These violent crowds were stirred up by NZ media AND the cowardly new PM. Unable to refute the loss of NZ women’s rights, they chose to smear KJK with lies & rile up violence to prevent the women from simply speaking about their experiences.

,"🇮🇳 Sana representing India.
A Sari is an Indian cultural dress made for women. Besides the Sari, there is a wider variety of local clothes that women also wear during casual and ceremonial settings. The salwar kameez—salwar is one of them. This consists of loose pants, and kameez is the shirt. As you can see, it’s custom-made with beautiful tassels and exquisite lace attached to the dupatta, embroidery and sequins work on the Kurta. Another type is Anarkali style. It is a long shirt that flows out (great for spinning around), usually worn with a churidar underneath and a dupatta/scarf. A churidar is tighter than a Salwar, it bunches at the ankles. Traditionally men wear Kurta Pyjama - kurta is a loose fitting tunic/ knee-length shirt that is worn with Shalwar or Churidar. There are different types of work done on the Kurta. In this picture, you will see some simple embroidery work done on the collar and neckline. This can be customised depending on the occasion.

,"The Gore District Council yesterday backed away from its push to vote on a motion of no confidence in the Mayor Ben Bell, instead taking a more conciliatory stance.

The council had called an extraordinary meeting to vote on a motion of no confidence in the mayor and strip him of his committee assignments, but today no-one around the table was willing to support either motion.

The council said that in a move to restore trust with the public and amongst each other, elected members had agreed to put their differences aside and refocus on serving the people of the Gore District.

In the joint statement, the elected members said they reunited following an in-depth, transparent, and honest conversation.

"Anzac Day volunteer Michael Bain with his father's medals, including the New Zealand Special Service Medal (centre medal) for service at Mururoa on board HMNZS Otago.","Reflections on Anzac Day by Michael Bain:
I come from a heritage of service. My great grandfather was an engineer in WWII and my grandfather served in Jay Force post WWII.
For me, it is my father who I primarily honour on Anzac Day. He served in the the NZ Navy in the 1970s and was part of the crew of HMNZS Otago when it was sent to Mururoa Atoll in 1973.
The NZ government stationed them there to draw the world’s attention to the French conducting atmospheric nuclear testing. The Otago was on site when France conducted a nuclear test on 21 July 1973. It was the first time a country had sent their military to protest against nuclear testing and this action is the foundation of NZ’s nuclear free stance today.
These Navy sailors served their country and were welcomed home as heroes initially.
Sadly, since then and despite PM Norman Kirk promising to look after them, the men have been forgotten by NZ. It is as if their service didn’t count with no mention in Anzac Day services, while the rest of the country took pride in being nuclear free.
It wasn’t until 2002 that they were entitled to a medal recognising their service. That was unfortunately too late for my father, who died in 1999 at the age of 48. Unrecognised by the country he served, unknown to the NZ public.
For me, he will never be forgotten and every Anzac Day I honour him and the men he served with.
My commemoration starts the night before, when I pin my father’s medals to a suit jacket, making sure they are on the correct side of the jacket and straight – always on the right for family members.
I attend the dawn service at Tāmaki Paenga Hira Auckland War Memorial Museum, having done so since I returned to Auckland in 2007, proudly wearing my father’s medals. I remembering dad and the other brave sailors who answered their country’s call and did their duty. I often shed a tear and finish off by laying a poppy on the cenotaph.
This year, for the 50th anniversary, I am looking forward to hearing them acknowledged at this year’s Anzac Day services for the first time. I hope it will be the beginning of our nation regularly recognising the important service these men gave to Aotearoa.
Lest we forget.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","1080","1080","https://instagram.fdmm2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/342061427_609913984392203_8288962111947328042_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fdmm2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=MHCSv6pjnx0AX9jiTlP&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDLgRnTOOctlVnoMmYSTMOh21GkO-vd2K0NEzqzYpiu3A&oe=646F8EC3&_nc_sid=62388f","With Anzac Day tomorrow, we asked Aucklanders to tell us us how they commemorate this special day and honour our veterans.

,"Central Otago residents say they are tired of feeling unnerved and being constantly on alert with wild pigs running amok around St Bathans.

In March, a man was knocked out after a wild boar charged him near his cottage, dislocating his shoulder with its tusk narrowly missing his eye.

St Bathans only has a handful of residents, but they are outnumbered by wild pigs that are destroying their gardens and the township.

Long term resident Keith Hinds has seen a number of them including a big, black boar lumbering through the township one afternoon and a large group with piglets.

He has been taking precautions.

""Just being alert. Every time I make sure all the gates are closed, take a decent torch when you go out to the car to lock the vehicle.

He did not believe wild pigs were naturally aggressive, but said they could attack if they felt threatened, cornered or are separated from their young.

He was worried visitors could get entranced by the cute piglets and not see a protective adult pig nearby.

""Lots and lots of tourists every day even now coming through, and I'm just concerned that they or the six local residents may get attacked one time.""

,"🇳🇿 Noeleen representing Aotearoa/New Zealand.
He wahine Māori, he wahine o Ihirama. My piupiu is made from muka - the fibre prepared from flax leaves. It has an uncomplicated straight line pattern etched into the dried flax leaves. The whiri is the plaited fibre of the waistband. This piupiu holds a story about cultural preservation. This Kāhu Huruhuru (feathered cloak) was machine stitched together using contemporary materials that are most likely manufactured offshore.
The taniko border has pātikitiki (flounder, diamond) patterns and characterises our Ngati Porou traditions of self-sustainability. The many huruhuru symbolizes whākapapa both here in Aotearoa and overseas. The Kāhu Huruhuru (feathered cloak) carries many stories as it has feathers. Significantly this modern style cloak is embracing my whānau intersecting identities. This Kāhu Huruhuru holds stories of our cultural resilience and manaakitanga. Ko Hikurangi te Maunga Ko Waiapu te Awa.

,"Customs Minister Meka Whaitiri has announced she has quit Labour and will stand for Te Pāti Māori - a surprise move Labour says has not been explained.

Whaitiri confirmed the move on Wednesday in an event at Waipatu marae in Hastings, saying the decision to cross the floor was not an easy one, but was the right one.

""This morning, I have officially notified the Speaker that I have resigned from the Labour Party and am joining Te Pāti Māori,"" she said.

Whaitiri, in her speech at the marae, offered little explanation of her decision to quit Labour, referring instead to a commitment to Māori political activism.

""He Whakaputanga, Te Tiriti o Waitangi, Te Kotahitanga, Ngā Komiti Wāhine, Māori Council, Māori Women's welfare league, Congress, Hapu Authorities, marae, iwi chairs - the point here whānau is Māori political activism is part of being Māori. It comes from our whakapapa and we as Māori have a responsibility to it.

""Today I'm acknowledging that whakapapa, I'm acknowledging my responsibility to it and it's calling me home.""

Tearing up, she delivered a message to the electorate: ""To the voters of Ikaroa-Rāwhiti, I have served you tirelessly for the last 10 years. Let me continue to serve you.""

""As the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti sitting MP, I intend to be seated with Te Pāti Māori when we return to Parliament, joining an unapologetic Māori political movement to achieve what was promised to us 183 years ago.”

,"Anzac Day took an unexpected turn this year for a member of the public and two Tāmaki Makaurau Motorway Patrol officers.

Senior Constable Errol Diprose and Constable Matthew Riley were called into action after a member of the public lost his grandfather’s war medals on Auckland’s Northern Motorway.

The North Shore-based man had attended the ANZAC Day dawn service with his young family before driving home. A short time later, he headed back out - and as he drove, something falling on to the road caught his eye in his rear vision mirror.

Checking to ensure he had his wallet and phone, he remembered placing his grandfather’s treasured war medals on the roof of his vehicle while securing his young children in their car seats.

With a sinking heart he realised that it was the medals that had flown off the car roof. Unbelievably they had survived the trip home from the service, but not the second outing.

Unsure who to call, he phoned Police for advice, giving precise information about where and when the medals flew off the roof and a detailed description of what they looked like.

Errol and Matthew were tasked with helping to search for the irreplaceable medals, so they contacted the man and got a photo of them.

The officers conducted a rolling block to slow traffic and enable the search and, within minutes, they retrieved three of the four medals. The fourth medal remains at large.

“I wasn’t sure who to call, or what to do, and didn’t hold much hope of getting them back. Police’s response was so quick and I’m so relieved to have three of them returned – only hours after I lost them.”

Errol says the medals were scattered along the shoulder of the motorway and in the carriageway.

“We managed to find three of the four medals but unfortunately, they had been struck by several vehicles when we found them.

The North Shore man is grateful to Police for the huge effort and quick response and is making enquiries about how to restore the medals to their former glory in honour of his grandad.",,"","0","810","1080","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/344875809_1432880297542367_7602458558324310178_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=C4ix9qiychIAX_eB6qj&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC8h8yVMXpyqNxxjdc7oyGASau2x9ge7xM2Ww17W4vP6A&oe=646F4E26&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096956268360020882",,,"Cr6mVFUhLOS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr6mVFUhLOS/",,,,,"","0","810","1080","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/345132062_243852694979819_5959196701782523753_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=1tThnweedhgAX-Ni2ze&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDQAL4brUAx811e8ecNOpppWmmFaD0ZNyxxvZxyb0p84g&oe=6471277E&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096956268368488714",,,"Cr6mVFVBekK",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr6mVFVBekK/",,,,,"","0","361","480","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/345330006_619259016451883_3074680876991228839_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=-mXQZQgMv4EAX_lhMeP&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB169Yu9pqSTNKPY87ucv2jBdC8uvWaCI8f9tiI7cxnXg&oe=647019C9&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096956268360140695",,,"Cr6mVFUhoeX",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr6mVFUhoeX/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"22","810","1080","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/344875809_1432880297542367_7602458558324310178_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=C4ix9qiychIAX_eB6qj&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC8h8yVMXpyqNxxjdc7oyGASau2x9ge7xM2Ww17W4vP6A&oe=646F4E26&_nc_sid=62388f","That haircut is not messing about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3096956274173479221","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/344875809_1432880297542367_7602458558324310178_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=C4ix9qiychIAX_eB6qj&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfC8h8yVMXpyqNxxjdc7oyGASau2x9ge7xM2Ww17W4vP6A&oe=646F4E26&_nc_sid=62388f","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/345132062_243852694979819_5959196701782523753_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=1tThnweedhgAX-Ni2ze&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDQAL4brUAx811e8ecNOpppWmmFaD0ZNyxxvZxyb0p84g&oe=6471277E&_nc_sid=62388f","https://instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/345330006_619259016451883_3074680876991228839_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fixj2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=-mXQZQgMv4EAX_lhMeP&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB169Yu9pqSTNKPY87ucv2jBdC8uvWaCI8f9tiI7cxnXg&oe=647019C9&_nc_sid=62388f",,,,,,,,"false","18267035614125145","1","gonethewayofthedinosaurs",,,,,,,,,,,"0","That haircut is not messing about.","2023-05-07T19:22:30.000Z","17963638805290235","0","air.wade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","We need Auckland Motorway Patrol officers.","2023-05-07T10:51:45.000Z","17973528281252752","0","melissaduarteducatti",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","😊","2023-05-07T05:21:37.000Z","18256417594196391","0","kt_perky",,,,,,,,,,,,"@stevethomas1304 sorry that is what you believe, because if you knew the beauty of te Ao Māori (the Māori World) you wouldn’t be able to help but see things differently.

,"A karakia was held as the first of two bodies were taken from Loafers Lodge. 

Two members of Te Ātiawa led the ceremony as police and firefighters lined part of the road where a hearse briefly stopped before leaving the site. 

More bodies will be recovered on Friday. 

“This is an incredibly difficult time for all those impacted by this tragedy particularly those who are still waiting for news of their loved ones,” said Inspector Dion Bennett. 

“I can assure you we are doing everything we can to identify and recover the deceased and loved ones from the Loafers Lodge as quickly as we can.”

It’s a bit of a running gag – the Finance Minister has a name to sum up his budget, and everyone else piles on with what they’d call it instead – sometimes, to savage or hilarious effect.

,"A new hauntingly clear scan of the Titanic could shed light on the mysteries surrounding its ill-fated maiden voyage. 

In an extraordinary endeavour, two submersible vessels have captured a staggering 700,000 images of the shipwreck, constructing a digital replica of the ocean liner that rests 3800m beneath the ocean's surface. 

Deep-sea mapping company Megellan Ltd took the project on last year in collaboration with Atlantic Production. 

Scientists are hailing the model as a “game-changer” with the potential to ""completely rewrite"" our understanding of the heart-wrenching tragedy that claimed more than 1,500 lives in 1912.

,"King Charles III has been crowned at Westminster Abbey for the first Coronation in 70 years. 👑

The 74-year-old is the oldest person to take on the British throne after his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died last year in September.

Camilla, 75, has officially become the Queen - a move from her title of Queen Consort which was agreed upon with the King's mother before her death.

Although the procession and service featured customs dating back 1000 years, there were some departures from tradition. This included the involvement of leaders from other faiths, the royal monarch attire, and the pledging of allegiance to the King.

,"Heavy rain is causing havoc in Auckland and Northland as more warnings are issued and people are being warned to prepare for evacuations.

Auckland mayor Wayne Brown has confirmed to RNZ that he has declared a state of emergency and has delegated powers to his deputy, Desley Simpson.

Brown is in Sydney on business but will cut short the trip and return to the region tonight.

Auckland Transport says surface flooding is widespread in parts of West Auckland and is urging people to stay clear of floodwaters.

Several schools have also been evacuated in the region.

And an emergency alert has been sent out: ""Heavy rain and thunderstorms are affecting the Auckland region and expected to continue into the evening, potentially through to midnight tonight,"" it said.

,"The coroner’s court has been read a series of “concerning” text messages sent by Mike Zhao-Beckenridge and John Beckenridge just before their disappearance.⁠
⁠
The text messages were sent to friends, and to Mike’s mother Fiona Lu, saying “Bye from John and Mike”, that “the midnight express is leaving very shortly” and for people not to contact anyone after the texts.⁠
⁠
Based on these text messages, sent between 1.41-1.45pm and on March 20, 2015, police inferred John was intending to take his life.⁠
⁠
This was the last evidence to suggest the pair were alive.⁠

,"Gul Hussien, his wife Mujaheda, and his family narrowly escaped Kabul, Afghanistan in late 2021.

When the Taliban retook power after 20 years of US military occupation, ordinary citizens like Gul, who is a Hazara, a member of a Shiite Muslim minority, found themselves in a desperately dangerous situation.
Gul and his family narrowly escaped, and now must rebuild their lives in Auckland.

Like many refugees Gul has complex feelings about where home is. “I think I’m still like a bird, flying. Even though I’m here I still cannot forget that I had a home, a family in Afghanistan. So, if I say this is my home then what is that that I left behind?”
—
There are over 100 million displaced people across the globe. Thirty-two million of them are #refugees. Each year New Zealand takes in around 1000 refugees who fled to escape persecution or war.
 
This season of #noplacelikehome follows the dramatic journeys of six refugee families as they resettle in New Zealand.

,"Green Party co-leaders Marama Davidson and James Shaw have responded to the resignation of MP Elizabeth Kerekere, who has hit out at the handling of an investigation into her behaviour.

The investigation was launched when she mistakenly sent a disparaging comment about her colleague Chloe Swarbrick to the wrong chat group.

Since then, multiple sources close to the party have spoken to RNZ anonymously, criticising Kerekere's broader treatment of caucus colleagues and staff.

The MP quit the party on Friday evening and said she would stay on as an independent until the election when she would retire.

Davidson acknowledged it was a challenging time for the party.

She said the Greens were a Te Tiriti o Waitangi-based party with a ""proud record of championing Māori political aspirations"".

""For more than three decades, the party has cared and stood up for what is right. We have stayed true to our values in Parliament and in government, leading the fight to eliminate poverty, honour Te Tiriti, protect nature and build a climate-friendly future.”",,"","0","1344","1080","https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/344788811_892899981816529_3753042428488374227_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=TzkTN8kNLrkAX_Fsrze&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAz16Mxjb0VJvsVNLJWXUc2VotNEZaNXeOGUGVb7pAkww&oe=646F4F9B&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096387500204444190",,,"Cr4lAaspUoe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr4lAaspUoe/",,,,,"","0","1344","1080","https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/344808482_628823942463978_1667664045403270881_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=GmjJY2Dnp64AX_JMUU4&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBIldAKUKFGK7aIafCz6j5lHfbtQ9FCsfu0AFOygOYb-g&oe=646F63F1&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096387500204532841",,,"Cr4lAaspqRp",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr4lAaspqRp/",,,,,"","0","1344","1080","https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/345025870_949347426262387_425386267127538510_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=dcrSC_wWlcUAX-ORutU&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA-Iqzbs_E0iKSj6rMeQsLtpmLVZbyy6LoVr5FOd0sesA&oe=6471357D&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096387500187586359",,,"Cr4lAarpA83",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr4lAarpA83/",,,,,"","0","1344","1080","https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/344784893_613295593801457_7166635583286457526_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=BJl7icfeqlAAX96uXD7&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBc6wn1YBpeE-mNs23vq34yL4AhYjHtQmnEmicRzC0Qiw&oe=6470D685&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096387500254832797",,,"Cr4lAavpiid",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr4lAavpiid/",,"","0","1344","1080","https://scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/344859186_1462408810830664_523517531932500378_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mad2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=3-zqCLQQDjsAX8VK95L&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBDDJztzV6fpEr4KymDtozJwwzMoWFhF13atKfNpCAZhw&oe=64710F16&_nc_sid=62388f","","3096387500196056223",,,"Cr4lAasJUyf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cr4lAasJUyf/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"41","1344","1080","https://scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/344788811_892899981816529_3753042428488374227_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-mad1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=TzkTN8kNLrkAX_Fsrze&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAz16Mxjb0VJvsVNLJWXUc2VotNEZaNXeOGUGVb7pAkww&oe=646F4F9B&_nc_sid=62388f","For

,"Thousands of tonnes of second-hand clothes are exported from New Zealand to Papua New Guinea every year.⁠
⁠
In 2022, 5469 tonnes of worn clothes were exported to Papua New Guinea, a slight decrease from 5902 tonnes in 2019, according to Stats NZ.⁠
⁠
The influx of second-hand clothing provides jobs, but also hinders development, says Yaku Ninich, a clothes designer from Papua New Guinea who has been in the fashion industry for over 10 years.⁠
⁠
“We are getting way more than we need. The behaviour (used clothing exports to Papua New Guinea) should change because we are making our own clothes right now.”⁠
⁠
At least 30% of those second-hand bales were “in very poor condition”.⁠
⁠
“They would not even put that out, or sell to New Zealand citizens”, Ninich says.⁠
⁠
Besides old clothes with stains and rips, used underwear, bras and underskirts have been “passed on” to Papua New Guinea’s consumers in the bales, which “raises issues of human dignity and should be banned”.⁠

,"After the devastating impact of land loss, there is an understandable reluctance among some Māori to give up the land they have left. But the changing climate will eventually inflict more pain on the most flood-prone places.

Two kilometres south of Katikati township stands the kāinga and marae of hapū Ngāi Tamawhāirua. Hapū member Ngairo Eruera proudly describes it as ""Katikati's best-kept secret"".

""It's right by the highway, but you have to turn off to find it,"" he chuckles.

Their papakāinga is built on wetlands, with some whare located in particularly low-lying areas - ""primarily because it was the only land left,"" Eruera explains.

A river snakes around their marae, Te Rereatukāhia, and it's calm most of the time. But when the heavy rain of Cyclone Gabrielle came pouring down in February, the river level began to rise.

In 2020, the hapū engaged with Takarangi Research, a small research team, that started working to develop tikanga-based and community-relevant responses to climate change.

""Some of the current flood mapping indicates housing areas through low-lying parts of the kāinga, definitely through the wetland, will be inundated,"" he says.

""The reality is that within 50 to 100 years, we're talking about relocation of the current kāinga,"" Eruera says. ""We understand that this could not probably be part of the current generation's solution, but it will definitely be part of our solution around our tamariki.""

Eruera says the conversations are tense.

""For some of them it's almost entrenched in them, this view to stay put. And we have to respect that but that doesn't mean we have to like it.""

,"“If you plan to try for children, Charlie, you should do it within the next four years.”

The Deadline issued to a 26-year-old Charlie Dreaver came as she was diagnosed with endometriosis, a condition she suffered with for years before surgery.

Dreaver, like many other women with the same diagnosis, suddenly had to reassess her life plans. And fast. 

In an In Depth series for RNZ, she speaks to other women about their journey with the condition, as well as experts to inform her decision making.

She sets out to open the conversation about endometriosis and its effect on those who suffer from it.

,"REVIEW | As a self-proclaimed veteran fan of The 1975, I felt as though it was my moral obligation to attend this concert with the sole purpose of writing this very review.

I've been through hell and high water with this band since the release of their debut album in 2013; their music soundtracked my early teens up until my early 20s. Finding their fame on platforms such as Tumblr and Twitter, they're a band that a lot of late-millennials and early gen-z'ers grew up with.

Fans were lined up outside Spark Arena from as early as 8am the day before the show - some of them had come directly from the show in Wellington the night prior, and a small handful had also travelled from as far as the US, and as close as Newmarket to get as close to the band as they possibly could.

As 9pm hits, the big screen feeds a live video of Matty backstage as Love Me Tender by Elvis Presley plays over the speakers. The acronym ATPOAIM - A Theatrical Performance of an Intimate Moment - flashes on screen as the live feed watched Matty pace back and forth, before coming on stage to perform an acoustic medley of Oh Caroline, I Couldn't Be More In Love, and Sincerity is Scary.

With a wine bottle and a cigarette in hand, it's almost like the old Matty I first encountered in 2013, a decade ago, was on stage.

It was hard to tell, at points, whether or not Healy's drunken stumbling on stage and occasional murmuring was all a part of a bit he's just super committed to, or if he's just a really good actor. The show builds this world within a world that's a bit hard to grasp. After breaking character (allegedly) in the middle of the show, he sits down and essentially starts a group therapy session with all 12,000 people at Spark Arena.

""The whole thing is getting a bit weird because it's self-referential. The character in the show is me. And the show is about someone who makes mistakes and does the wrong thing.""

,"Aotearoa was built on the back of the horse.

The first horses were imported by a missionary in 1814 and were quickly being used for transport, farming and even kept in underground stables to work in mines.

Of course, after automobiles were introduced, horse numbers began to dwindle, but in the more rugged and remote places where hillsides slipped and rivers flooded, the animals remained an important part of the rural landscape until the 1960s.

Even today there are farmers who still use horses and some who like to give young farmhands a horse to “bring on” because they understand what Winston Churchill meant when he said, “there is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man”.

For a taste of what New Zealand might have been like in the days of horses, there's Canterbury Backcountry — and as Roisin Magee finds out, midwinter is one of the most beautiful times of the year to experience it.

,"🇦🇹 Lisa & Barbara representing Austria.
A Dirndl is a primary folk costume for women and girls in Austria, Switzerland, parts of Germany and Italy. It consists of a close-fitting bodice with a low neckline, a white blouse that is worn under the bodice, a high waisted skirt attached to the bodice with an apron. Some women choose to wear a beautiful silk scarf with their dirndl to cover the décolletage in line with traditional Catholic ideas around modesty. Most Dirndls will maintain these basic features, but their style and colour will vary based on the different regions. There is less of an emphasis on individuals having to wear the style connected to their hometown compared to wearing a dirndl which just resonated with them and what they like. Traditional Dirndls were made of dark, heavy cotton so that they could withstand the wear and tear of everyday life. More modern designs are made of linen, velvet or silk, but cotton remains the most favoured material.

,"“It’ll help.” 
 
Kiwis have shared their mixed reactions to the Government's 'no frills' Budget 2023 amidst the rising cost of living crisis and ahead of a general election. 

Kaitaia resident Mari Wharemate expressed the challenges her family faced, battling rising prices and living conditions in state housing. 

Solo mum Janelle Richardson said she was disappointed over the lack of help for soaring food and petrol costs. 

Nonetheless, Kiwis have welcomed the boost for early childhood education and the help it will give parents across the country.

,"A sudden change of heart echoed silently around the room as Gore District Councillors passed up the opportunity to boot their young mayor just days after loudly calling for him to resign. 

Crowds of locals turned up to the extraordinary public meeting to support Gore Mayor Ben Bell, cheering him on as the motion for a vote of no confidence was met with silence and eventually lapsed. 

The community's strong backing showed through protests demanding the resignation of CEO Steve Parry, who’s been at odds with Bell. 

Inside the council meeting, Bell received a warm welcome and applause despite the recent controversy. 

The councillors pledged their solidarity with the mayor, shifting the focus to rebuilding trust and getting on with the job.

,"☕️🥙🍢⁠ What makes a great local? Is it the barista whose coffee, and bright smile, wake you up in the morning? The publican who knows not only your name but how work’s going this week? Or the food truck that brings an otherwise quiet street to life?⁠ ☕️🥙🍢⁠
⁠
The best local hospitality businesses give flavour not just to their food but their neighbourhood. They fill not just our bellies but our cups.⁠
⁠
And it’s time to celebrate them.⁠ That’s why Stuff is launching the inaugural #LoveYourLocal Awards, presented by Pure South.⁠
⁠
We want you to nominate your most-loved local people and places in the following categories: food truck or takeaway; roadside stall; barista; bartender or publican; front of house person or team; and new business.⁠
⁠
Tell us who you love, and why, and they could be up for the title in your region.⁠
⁠
Once nominations have closed we’ll ask you to vote for your favourite amongst the finalists, to determine regional winners from around the motu, as voted by you, the locals.⁠
⁠
Then we’re going one further: all your regional winners will be up for the national title in each category, as determined by our judging panel made up of top New Zealand chef and unofficial food ambassador Peter Gordon, Eat New Zealand CEO and owner of permaculture property The Food Farm Angela Clifford, and Stuff food editor Emily Brookes.⁠

Survivors recount their harrowing experiences following the devastating Wellington hostel fire that has killed at least six people. 

Miimetua Cameron, a resident of the second floor, says she only knew about the fire after a neighbour called her after not seeing her outside. 

Investigations continue as the community waits to find out what caused this very real nightmare.

,"Residents who escaped the blaze that engulfed a Wellington hostel overnight are trying to make sense of how the tragedy happened. 

Authorities confirmed Loafers Lodge didn’t have sprinklers, and residents say fire alarms were often ignored. 

The 1970s-era building had been a church and a bank before it was converted into a 94-room hostel. 

The Prime Minister said, “the building code does not require the retro-fitting of sprinkler systems into existing older buildings so there'll be a number of buildings that fall into that category”. 

Investigations into the cause of the fatal fire are underway.

,"At least 6 people have died in a “once-in-a-decade” fire that broke out overnight in a Wellington hostel. 

Prime Minister Chris Hipkins confirmed the fatalities in the Loafers Lodge tragedy, saying it “looks like there are likely to be more”. 

Firefighters were alerted to the blaze on Adelaide Rd in Newtown at around 12:25 am. 

By 4am, 20 fire trucks were at the scene battling the fire, which escalated to a fifth alarm. 

So far, 52 people have been accounted for, but there are still individuals missing. Loafers Lodge housed around 92 people, many of them shift workers. 

Residents nearby are advised to remain indoors and keep their windows and doors closed due to the smoke.

,"Does it pay to do your research before filling up at the petrol pump? Some people swear by it – and they make serious savings.

Woolston’s Ferry Rd boasts some of Christchurch’s lowest fuel prices, as much as 30c less than at other gas stations.

When The Press visited on Wednesday every pump was occupied. A litre of 91 petrol cost $2.18, making it the cheapest in the city, according to the Gaspy app.

,"With flights costing more than ever, it’s understandable that travellers are keen to get the most out of the experience.⁠
⁠
We cram as much luggage as we can into the overhead bins. We obsess over seat selection. And we have very strong opinions about inflight snacks and meals.⁠
⁠
But there might be some freebies we’re missing out on. Airlines often have additional amenities that are available on request – even for those of us in economy.⁠

,"The national kapa haka organisation, Te Matatini, has received a $17 million per year increase in funding in the Budget.⁠
⁠
Its funding boost followed steady criticism about why other cultural organisations, such as the national orchestra and ballet company, received millions more than Te Matatini.⁠
⁠
Funding for Te Matatini was a highlight feature for kaupapa Māori in Budget 2023, with Government MPs including Finance Minister Grant Robertson saying its funding boost, coupled with $18 million to support more Matariki celebrations, showed progress in valuing Māori culture.⁠
⁠
Whānau Ora also received a $168 million funding boost, spread across the next four years.⁠

,"The board of trustees in charge of an Auckland school that hired a rapist as a teacher aide has resigned en masse.⁠
⁠
Stuff revealed the school had hired the teenager, who was closely related to the principal, eight months ago. He resigned hours after the story was published.⁠
⁠
The teenager had raped one young woman and sexually violated another when he was aged between 14 and 17.⁠
⁠
The school’s board of trustees initially backed the principal, telling parents they were confident no students had been put at risk.⁠
⁠
However, five months later, in February, the principal resigned after an investigation by a lawyer found the hiring process did not meet “procedural and legislative requirements”.⁠

,"Hawke’s Bay’s rundown water theme amusement park Splash Planet needs more than $2 million in repairs and the local council is considering whether it’s worth opening it for next summer.⁠
⁠
The park, which includes several pools, waterslides, lazy river, and other activities, was formerly known as Fantasyland before being rebranded and reopened in 1998. It’s been managed, funded and governed by Hastings District Council since 2004.⁠
⁠
The park copped criticism by numerous visitors last summer for shoddy, rundown and unclean conditions. It is usually open from November through to late March but closed on February 7 this year due to labour shortages.⁠

,"The All Blacks will have another chance to familiarise themselves with controversial referee Mathieu Raynal prior to the World Cup.⁠

The Frenchman, of time-wasting free-kick infamy in last year’s Bledisloe Cup game in Melbourne, and who also presided over New Zealand’s drawn season-ender with England, has been appointed to take charge of the All Blacks’ Rugby Championship clash against the Springboks at Go Media Stadium Mt Smart on July 15.⁠

,"The sun might still be shining in some parts of the country, but the chilly months are just around the corner. For some families, that means a struggle to cover the costs of heating the house.⁠
⁠
With a few, practical, simple changes, however, we can all shave a significant amount off our bills during winter. For example, did you know you could save above $450 a year on your power bill just by cutting five minutes off your daily shower? That’s based on the average family of four.⁠
⁠
""We know that most households can make really simple changes in their home to make better use of their energy,"" says Bridget Abernathy, chief executive of ERANZ, which runs a free coaching service, Energy Mate, to help families struggling to cover their power bills.⁠
⁠
The association has collated all their money-saving advice into one place: energymate.nz. ""There are some quite helpful little tips and tricks people can use.”⁠

,"New Zealand music's best gathered in Auckland on Tuesday night to celebrate the Taite Music Prize, which this year went to Princess Chelsea for her album Everything Is Going To Be Alright. Princess Chelsea was in New York and could not attend the ceremony but dialled in via a pre-recorded Zoom call.

The Taite Music Prize, named after the late music journalist Dylan Taite, highlights outstanding New Zealand albums released in the previous calendar year.

Princess Chelsea, also known as Chelsea Nikkel, is an Auckland-based singer, songwriter, classically trained pianist and producer.

In 2022, RNZ's Tony Stamp said the album's songs were the best Princess Chelsea had written.

Nikkel has a global following; The Cigarette Duet, her 2011 song with collaborator Jonathan Bree, has received more than 90 million views on YouTube.

Te Kaahu O Rangi, an album of nine waiata sung in te reo Māori by TE KAAHU (singer-songwriter Theia, pictured above) won Best Independent Debut at the awards evening.

Paul Huggins, an active supporter of New Zealand musicians for more than two decades, was given the Independent Spirit Award in recognition of his contributions to the local music community.

Namnita Kumar and Nadia Freeman, who create the Eastern Sound Stories Podcast, received the NZ On Air Outstanding Music Journalism award.

,"Dawn services have been held to mark Anzac Day, with the National Commemorative Service now underway at Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington.

Historian Rowan Light said Anzac Day has become Aotearoa's national day of unity, and he thinks it will remain so.

The success of the commemorations was out of public interest in the stories of the Anzacs that continue to be told, he said.

Prime Minister Chris Hipkins says Anzac Day has come to mean far more than a commemoration of the 1915 Gallipoli campaign.

Mr Hipkins told RNZ he thinks about his grandfathers, who were Second World War veterans, along with the sacrifices of other servicemen and women, including peacekeepers.

Dame Helen Winkelmann also paid a special nod to the work our Defence Force does in times of natural disasters.

""This Anzac Day, many New Zealanders are still facing the impact of recent devastating weather events. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the New Zealand Defence Force which has worked alongside local agencies, iwi, and community groups to provide vital assistance.

In times of war and disaster, New Zealanders have always done what they can to help their affected neighbours and communities - a heartening reminder of the goodness and humanity that underpins our society.""

A ceremony will be held on the Waitangi Treaty Grounds this evening to commemorate the members of the Māori Battalion.

The last surviving member, Tā Robert Gillies, will present the Campaign and Battle Honours Memorial Flag at Te Rau Aroha Museum.

,"Wellington Zoo has today welcomed two female snow leopards - Asha and Manju.

Wellington Zoo chief executive Karen Fifield said the snow leopards may look quite big but that was thanks to their fluffy coats, they are actually smaller than a lion or tiger.

Asha was the feisty one of the pair and Manju was incredible relaxed, she said.

Fifield said the pair were used to the hot weather as they were born in Melbourne.

An environmental engineer was brought on board when the zoo was thinking about taking on the care of Asha and Manju. It was found there was only about one degree difference between their range state and Wellington temperatures, Fifield said.

,"“I have a son [who is] off to university. Your mortgage doesn’t go down because you are sick.”

A gravely ill IBM worker on sick leave for the past 15 years has insisted he is not greedy for trying to sue the tech giant because they have not given him a pay rise.

Senior British IT technician Ian Clifford, 50, was signed off work in 2008 for mental-health related reasons and was diagnosed with stage four leukaemia in 2012.

Under an IBM health plan, while off work he receives more than £54,000 ($108,285) a year, guaranteed until the age of 65.

Last year, Clifford brought the tech giant to court for disability discrimination, arguing his salary had not been reviewed since 2013.

A judge threw out his claim at an employment tribunal in March, saying he had received a “very substantial benefit” and “favourable treatment”.

,"Dawa & Tenzin Choekyi representing Tibet.
Tibet is a high-altitude place (known as the Roof of the world) that is surrounded by snow-capped mountains of the Himalayas. Due to the cold weather, both male and female clothing is a long robe called CHUPA covers the whole body with authentic vibrant colours. Tibet has a rich culture and hence why there are so many different traditional attires depending on the province. With evolving generations, different materials have been used with a fancy blend of colours. What I am wearing is a simple day to day wearable traditional dress of TOEPA which comes from U-stang province. Women wear an undershirt called ‘uangchu’ and an outer body wrap robe called ‘chu ba’. Married women like me have to wear a multicoloured apron known as ‘pangden’ in the front. An extra layer of pangden called ‘kiptee’ is worn around the high waist and held by silver jewellery called ‘Belcha’. These layers of apron make indigenous people cope better with the alpine climate. Generally, every woman of the house weaves their apron and quilt. Women grow long hair and use rainbow-coloured hair looms called ‘tabshu’ to do plaiting to keep their hair nice and tidy.

,"Only one of the 26 companies testing out a 4-day work week is dropping the programme after 6 months. The rest of the staff in the Kiwi-led pilot are eager to keep the extra day off, and so are their bosses. 

An independent study of the 4 Day Week Global trial found that it's not just better gender equality outcomes that make the 4-day workweek so appealing; staff also reported less stress, better work-life balance, and increased exercise. 

That’s backed up by the companies involved too. One CEO in the pilot said, ""You can't afford not to do this. You can improve productivity, improve the bottom line, enhance employee well-being, and boost staff attraction and retention.""

,"The family of a pregnant bulldog they say was snatched under threat of violence on Sunday are “terrified” what will happen to their dog and its babies.⁠
⁠
Police have confirmed they are investigating the snatch, which appears to have stemmed from an agreement over ownership of the dog’s pups.⁠
⁠
Tauranga businesswoman Karen Sharma, mother of Black Ferns Sevens rugby player Angel Mulu, said the “family pet”, Mia, was taken from Blake Park, Mt Maunganui, while Mulu was coaching on the field.⁠

Angel Mulu plays prop for the Black Ferns internationally, and for the Chiefs in super rugby.

Mulu’s partner, Liam Morrison, was waiting with Mia in his car when the incident happened, Sharma said.

“Two men pulled up in a grey car beside him and one jumped in the front next to him,” Sharma recalled. “He had studded knuckle dusters. Another man got in behind who said he had a gun. They told my son-in-law that if he didn’t hand over the dog he would get shot. Liam is not a small man, but what are you going to do if someone says they are going to shoot you?”

,"Five gang members involved in the biggest art heist in modern history, stealing priceless 18th-century jewels from a Dresden museum, have been sentenced by a German court to up to six years in prison. 

In the 2019 break-in at the Gruenes Gewoelbe (Green Vault) museum in Dresden, the stolen pieces consisted of over 4,300 diamonds worth over $200 million. 

Among the stolen items were a breast star of the Polish Order of the White Eagle and an intricate diamond headdress. Fortunately, the majority of the stolen jewels have been recovered, as per police reports.

,"At 26, Charlie Dreaver was given a deadline. She was told she should start trying for children before she turned 30. 
 
The deadline, which was the result of an endometriosis diagnosis, meant she suddenly had to reassess her life plans. And fast. 

Now, within months of her 30th birthday, her deadline is looming. 

In an In Depth series for RNZ, Charlie Dreaver speaks to other women about their journey with the condition, as well as experts to inform her decision making. 

She sets out to open the conversation about endometriosis and its effect on those who suffer from it. She starts by sharing her own story.

,"For three decades, Peter Gordon (Ngāti Kahungunu, Ngāi Tahu) was Aotearoa’s peerless culinary emissary to the United Kingdom. ⁠
⁠
The Whanganui native only worked seriously in New Zealand for three years - during which he created the menu for seminal Wellington restaurant Sugar Club - before moving to London and becoming an absolute rock star.⁠
⁠
In London, @chefpetergordon set up two Sugar Clubs, The Providores and Tapa Room, Kopapa, and doughnut company Crosstown Doughnuts. He developed the menu for the Gourmet Burger Kitchen chain and consulted on restaurant openings in New York and Turkey.⁠
⁠
He was a proper celebrity chef, with a swathe of recipe books, regular spots on UK TV shows Saturday Kitchen and Sunday Brunch, and even a few hosting gigs of his own to his name.⁠
⁠
Gordon wove the literal and metaphorical flavours of New Zealand into everything he did, from Kopapa’s name to the flat whites all his establishments served, but he thought his unofficial ambassadorship would be a permanent post.⁠
⁠
“I always thought I’d live and retire and die in Europe somewhere,” he says. “And then around October 2019 I thought, actually, I want to go home. I’d not felt that for a while. I’d lived in the UK and London for 31 years, and it suddenly occurred to me that it was time to come home.”⁠

Thankfully staff were quick to intervene and saved the dog from potentially being hit by a vehicle.

,"Residents of a central Auckland street remain evacuated after a large blaze engulfed the rear of a house threatening two other neighbouring properties this morning.

Five fire trucks and three police cars were attending the scene in Epsom.

“The fire was very well-involved when we arrived. It is an old house so it spread very quickly. This also highlights the importance of making sure that we are all aware of evacuating out of the property and ensure we have got working smoke alarms.”

“The main occupant met me when we arrived and confirmed that everyone was out, which was our first priority.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"24","1921","1080","https://scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/347173467_203713299174941_7350243603678121260_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-atl3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=b_JkBi-sptUAX8-qSZa&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBhQprLRsiLR1xVd5PwCbhNB4a7qtbqMn6poBaPuQ60iQ&oe=646D2F9A&_nc_sid=62388f","I was wondering wat that smoke was @fast_n_furriest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3103840545873507553",,,,,,,,,,,"false","18357038245033667","0","sherralee12",,,,,,,,,,,,"I was wondering wat that smoke was @fast_n_furriest","2023-05-17T01:28:39.000Z","17985499466097929","0","olivialovestravel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"@donnakielar this is what we saw 😢","2023-05-16T20:49:45.000Z","18065361256379202","1","ourhome_children_and_youths_or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you: Hello my dear friend, we are looking for a refugee in your heart.

,"Police investigating the hostel fire in Wellington that claimed at least 6 lives early Tuesday morning have confirmed they’re treating it as suspicious. 

They are now the lead agency in the investigation, with the scene being handed over by Fire and Emergency on Wednesday afternoon.

In a statement, Police said the scene examination will be an extensive and methodical process and is expected to take some time – likely several days. 

They also confirmed reports of a couch fire at the same location earlier on Monday night, though they say it wasn’t reported to emergency services at the time.

,"#BREAKING | New Zealand’s oldest man Jack Coe has died. 💔💔

Jack’s 107th birthday made national headlines last week, with thousands of people wishing him well. He celebrated with cake and a zero-alcohol beer with family, friends and other residents at St John Wood Care Centre and Village on Thursday.

Until four months ago, Jack had been living in his own home in Marton but had recently moved to Taupō because of his health and to be closer to his son Peter Coe.

Peter said his father’s health had declined markedly in the past four months, but it was still a shock for the family.

Jack had told him recently that he would get to his 100th birthday and then “that’ll do”.

Rest in peace, Jack.",,"","0","1080","1080","https://instagram.fsaw2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/346672507_249167847668621_5734850548846406445_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fsaw2-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=3IIbK7KnP4sAX-CoHHd&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBkbMxyIF4pO6E8t7AyIpHAF1TU0k5XltK-CFjqoTvaxw&oe=647040AC&_nc_sid=62388f","","3102854680278188226",,,"CsPjeRfo8DC",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPjeRfo8DC/",,,,,"","0","1080","1080","https://instagram.fsaw2-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/345255717_958723398814612_2220698463499104704_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fsaw2-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=ByVlGm51RDMAX9tpFoS&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD2wnnplynwuOsV796jb-ZhPBLEfwHJeoU5RJcPVGZDGg&oe=6470B7B8&_nc_sid=62388f","","3102854680269658952",,,"CsPjeRfIZtI",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPjeRfIZtI/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"147","1080","1080","https://instagram.fsaw2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/346672507_249167847668621_5734850548846406445_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fsaw2-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=3IIbK7KnP4sAX-CoHHd&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBkbMxyIF4pO6E8t7AyIpHAF1TU0k5XltK-CFjqoTvaxw&oe=647040AC&_nc_sid=62388f","You jinxed him!","BREAKING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3102854688070961808","https://instagram.fsaw2-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/346672507_249167847668621_5734850548846406445_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fsaw2-2.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=3IIbK7KnP4sAX-CoHHd&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBkbMxyIF4pO6E8t7AyIpHAF1TU0k5XltK-CFjqoTvaxw&oe=647040AC&_nc_sid=62388f","https://instagram.fsaw2-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/345255717_958723398814612_2220698463499104704_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.fsaw2-3.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=ByVlGm51RDMAX9tpFoS&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD2wnnplynwuOsV796jb-ZhPBLEfwHJeoU5RJcPVGZDGg&oe=6470B7B8&_nc_sid=62388f",,,,,,,,,"false","17867798669919726","0","sina.himselff",,,,,,,,,,,,"You jinxed him!","2023-05-20T15:36:05.000Z","17934439682578390","0","babi.aj",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lo salaron","2023-05-19T08:03:42.000Z","17992879957823878","0","tekooti195749",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","NZ Herald...spreaders of misinformation...","2023-05-18T09:08:00.000Z","18035484859488953","0","kiwidee4224",,,,,,,,,,,"0","RIP Jack ❤️🙌","2023-05-17T22:45:02.000Z","17988042104066438","0","rochelle.rossouwnz",,,,,,,,,,,"0","Sending condolences ❤️","2023-05-17T19:01:59.000Z","17876919890828104","0","deanzyyyyyyy",,,,,,,,,,,"0","💗🙏🏽💕","2023-05-17T09:25:02.000Z","17988286597882087","0","fran85n",,,,,,,,,,,"0","Qué opinará de esto @alfremontes ?","2023-05-16T13:03:46.000Z","18084089515349190","0","acis666",,,,,,"0","😪","2023-05-16T12:09:33.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,"7668",,,,,,,,"The New Zealand Herald","435274611","nzherald",,"CsPjeYwIAqQ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-05-15T00:05:24.000Z","Sidecar","https://www.instagram.com/p/CsPjeYwIAqQ/",,,,

,"After Air New Zealand delivered the details of its lie-flat economy pods last week, there’s been one question that has left passengers restless:

How much would you pay for an hour’s sleep?

From next year, the Skynest bunk beds will be bookable in economy cabins flying to Chicago and New York, giving passengers the chance to sleep in one of six enclosed bunk beds.

With beds available for four hours at a time, your 40-winks will cost about $100 an hour. That’s about twice the cost of a night at an airport hotel.

So is the upgrade worth the money, or are you better investing in a good face mask and catching what sleep you can?

The screws act as a deterrent for offenders and reduce the chances of your number plate being stolen.",,"","0","810","1080","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339331640_251133614007208_868935428423795601_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=FkVVchpKAmgAX-Bntdm&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBWe_3RWfPLjlxg9Gsg8XEMVrZ8UQZHEHFThhdYXONoCA&oe=646F7DB3&_nc_sid=62388f","","3074021469327488643",,,"CqpHj1PMHaD",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CqpHj1PMHaD/",,,,,"","0","1080","1080","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339470800_1210938023120331_553975297574114846_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=Uljs1mJZhpsAX9UIbV3&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAiyKeeoZD9OqjeMt0IQnCtF3FlfxvUBV0vLa9eTR4QQg&oe=646F5DEF&_nc_sid=62388f","","3074021494250232099",,,"CqpHkMcs1kj",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CqpHkMcs1kj/",,,,,"","0","810","1080","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339494595_610063771169192_4416118362502409041_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=n7A3_zwEYeAAX8DBpqY&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDPmTRtxr8msS2Gv0nQVVB1X5THrZOt_VAUeFxIv8YIuw&oe=646FA356&_nc_sid=62388f","","3074021521076977877",,,"CqpHklbswDV",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CqpHklbswDV/",,,,,"","0","810","1080","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339502298_1279862349281384_2720269151312918291_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=LdFGI2jO3NYAX-J21Km&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBehYoM96-dnxRpxpsL8spSg8jORJEH5gVhFe9Ytb2KKw&oe=64708102&_nc_sid=62388f","","3074021550135014526",,,"CqpHlAfsXR-",,,,,,,,,,,,"Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/CqpHlAfsXR-/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2","810","1080","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339331640_251133614007208_868935428423795601_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=FkVVchpKAmgAX-Bntdm&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBWe_3RWfPLjlxg9Gsg8XEMVrZ8UQZHEHFThhdYXONoCA&oe=646F7DB3&_nc_sid=62388f","Will you guys be doing another anti-theft screw event, on a weekend?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3074021558464962086","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339331640_251133614007208_868935428423795601_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=FkVVchpKAmgAX-Bntdm&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBWe_3RWfPLjlxg9Gsg8XEMVrZ8UQZHEHFThhdYXONoCA&oe=646F7DB3&_nc_sid=62388f","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339470800_1210938023120331_553975297574114846_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=Uljs1mJZhpsAX9UIbV3&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAiyKeeoZD9OqjeMt0IQnCtF3FlfxvUBV0vLa9eTR4QQg&oe=646F5DEF&_nc_sid=62388f","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339494595_610063771169192_4416118362502409041_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=n7A3_zwEYeAAX8DBpqY&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDPmTRtxr8msS2Gv0nQVVB1X5THrZOt_VAUeFxIv8YIuw&oe=646FA356&_nc_sid=62388f","https://instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/339502298_1279862349281384_2720269151312918291_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.ftlv6-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_ohc=LdFGI2jO3NYAX-J21Km&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBehYoM96-dnxRpxpsL8spSg8jORJEH5gVhFe9Ytb2KKw&oe=64708102&_nc_sid=62388f",,,,,,,"false","18181790680259415","0","shaifromnz",,,,,,,,,,,,"Will you guys be doing another anti-theft screw event, on a weekend?","2023-04-07T03:37:30.000Z","18036171700454285","0","sajohashmi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Love Auckland police forever ❤️","2023-04-05T08:18:11.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"360",,,,,,,,"Auckland Police","1490188919","aucklandpolice",,"CqpHlIQMl4m",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-04-05T05:19:10.000Z","Sidecar","https://www.instagram.com/p/CqpHlIQMl4m/",,,,

A duty to their nation,
Fighting for freedom and justice,
With honor and determination.

They stood against the enemy,
With courage in their hearts,
And though many lost their lives,
They stood their ground in noble parts.

Their memories live on,
In every solemn ceremony,
Where we honor the fallen,
With respect and great testimony.

Their sacrifice was not in vain,

,"An investigation is under way after a teenage girl was shot in a central Auckland road rage incident Tuesday night.⁠
⁠
Detective senior sergeant, Martin Friend said just before 10pm, two vehicles – a hatchback and minivan – were travelling citybound on the Southern Motorway when the road rage incident began.⁠
⁠
“The driver of the hatchback has taken exception to the minivan and has begun to drive in an aggressive manner.”⁠
⁠
Both vehicles have continued onto the Northwestern Motorway and exited at St Lukes Rd.⁠
⁠
At about 10pm, shots were fired towards the rear of the minivan, and the teenage girl sitting in the back was shot.⁠

,"The mayor of Wellington, Tory Whanau, says the Loafers Lodge hostel in the capital is yet another example of society neglecting its most vulnerable people.⁠
⁠
“We’ve failed a sector of our community”, she told the Newsable podcast.⁠
⁠
“We’ve let some people down. We’ve let our vulnerable community down. And it shouldn’t take an accident of this nature to do that.”⁠
⁠
Whanau spoke to @newsablenz a day after a fire broke out at the hostel in Newtown, killing at least six with several more people unaccounted for.⁠

This would desensitize others to the alarms going off. But, if adults don't know how to cook for themselves then maybe some community support would help, would help solve both those problems.","2023-05-17T02:23:56.000Z","2","This is a lesson Councils and lawmakers need to learn real fast.  It is not compulsory to have sprinkler systems in these older buildings.  BUT people who are sleeping cannot smell smoke, they are therefore at huge risk in a building like this.  Sprinklers should be compulsory in commercial buildings where people will be sleeping.  Also, there were problems with the fire alarm, according to people interviewed, because residents don't know how to cook.  Maybe, some basic life skills could be taught by local community groups, so people can cook for themselves, or even organise teams who can cook for each other.","2023-05-17T00:52:12.000Z","17913749648756705","6","koko_fit20",,,,,,,,,,,"0","I don't think it's society, It's the people who are in power.","2023-05-17T00:19:52.000Z","17993835625923952","10","hataix2","18262027438196246","1","sandyjirish","@hataix2 wrong priorities","2023-05-17T00:24:59.000Z",,,,,,"1","She is so right.

,"Not a single Gore district councillor was prepared to put forward a vote of no confidence in 24-year-old mayor Ben Bell.⁠
⁠
Despite the deputy mayor Keith Hovell and seven councillors signing a requisition calling for an extraordinary meeting be held on Tuesday to pass a vote of no confidence – no one wanted to move the motion.⁠
⁠
Hovell had earlier said “the actions of the mayor in recent weeks had led to the difficult decision to request his resignation”.⁠
⁠
Instead, Bell and councillors apologised to the community and each other for the turmoil of recent days, and voted to write to Local Government New Zealand and Taituara asking it to assist with the terms of reference for an independent review to renew confidence in the council.⁠

,"Police have released fresh information into the homicide of a Lower Hutt man who was killed seven months ago.

Craig McKelvie, 52, was found seriously injured at a house in Mason St, Lower Hutt on October 14, 2022 and died later in hospital.

Police have identified a car whose passengers Detective Senior sergeant Martin Todd said may hold “crucial” information about the incident.

“Investigators have recently identified footage that shows a silver or light-coloured car, possibly a Toyota Prius, parked near the address where Mr McKelvie was fatally injured,” Todd said.

The car was parked on Mason St, near Randwick Cres and was still there when two other vehicles, one of which McKelvie was in, entered Mason St.

,"📢 Government intervention crucial to addressing AI risks, says OpenAI CEO during US Senate hearing 🤖💡 

Sam Altman stressed the need for government involvement in managing the potential risks posed by increasingly powerful AI systems. 

“As this technology advances, we understand that people are anxious about how it could change the way we live. We are too.” 

In his proposal, Altman suggested establishing a US or global agency licensing the most advanced AI systems, which would hold the authority to revoke licenses and enforce safety standards. 

Altman's San Francisco-based startup gained widespread attention following the launch of its chatbot tool, ChatGPT. 

Offering human-like responses, the tool has captured public interest since its release last year.

The name was announced at a ribbon-cutting ceremony this morning. The deal is for one year, with both parties keen to extend it after that time.

Mt Smart hasn’t had a naming sponsor since it was called Ericsson Stadium from 1995 to 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"48","1080","1080","https://scontent-iev1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/346899348_635482311764488_9202740800625142640_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=scontent-iev1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=HAoejtTI-FQAX_lIrLE&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAcwWGJGmFLsu1MXf2CXFnSZLPfus9Knbsy4LYw2fiUjw&oe=646F9468&_nc_sid=62388f","That is an awfully long name for a stadium.

,"Childbirth is full of unknowns, which is perhaps why expecting parents work so hard to have a plan. Which hospital should we go to? Should we opt for a birthing centre, or maybe a home birth? Epidural or no? Do we want a doula? What interventions are we comfortable with?⁠
⁠
But babies have little regard for adult ""plans,"" a trend that some researchers note persists throughout childhood.⁠
⁠
Some babies also demonstrate a poor sense of geography, judging by their decision to appear in locations not known for accommodating a labouring mother - places like ""planes"" and ""the back of the Camry"" and ""the shoulder of the interstate.""⁠

,"North Shore PST Constables Dana and Erin were refuelling their vehicle at a local service station when they heard a strange sound of plastic dragging from the other side of the forecourt. As Erin satisfied her craving for BP chicken bites, Dana investigated the source of the sound and found a hedgehog with its head stuck inside a bubble tea cup.

Dana immediately switched from police officer to an animal conservationist and put on her gloves to delicately remove the plastic cup from the hedgehog's head. After the cup was removed, she carefully picked up the little critter and placed it in a nearby bush. 

Thanks to Dana's quick thinking and kind actions, the hedgehog community could sleep a little easier that night, and Erin finally got her chicken bites 🦔🦔",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"49","1080","1080","https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/338426385_6125445220845901_5841400154231382406_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=vhIp7tPyFjIAX_D6e6k&edm=AABBvjUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCPuSD8_LrrdDE6swRmSbvvWiY1L07lOywEbLHEyiMpXA&oe=646FD28B&_nc_sid=62388f","Hedgehog bites?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"3070315862653686690",,,,,,,,,,,"false","17989491442763243","0","skitheclubbies",,,,,,,,,,,,"Hedgehog bites?","2023-04-05T08:40:07.000Z","17896129253708453","0","steilthomas5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"😍😍😍","2023-04-02T22:46:52.000Z","17989855918751459","0","nikorahinemoa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0","😂👏😍","2023-04-02T19:47:30.000Z","18210554590232086","0","christim90s",,,,,,,,,,,"0","Thank you!","2023-04-01T01:21:06.000Z","17883412601770810","0","rebeccapharazyn",,,,,,,,,,,"0","Cheeky little prick","2023-03-31T22:49:35.000Z","17971877900191198","0","king_of_cring29",,,,,,,,,,,"0","❤️😮","2023-03-31T22:16:51.000Z","18224589103201721","1","sharon.buchanan.509","17977737674113636","0","steilthomas5","@sharon.buchanan.509 oh well it's the same for me too😊😊","2023-04-02T22:46:41.000Z",,,,,,"1","Been there done that. ❤️","2023-03-31T21:19:54.000Z",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1464",,,,,,,,"Auckland Police","1490188919","aucklandpolice",,"Cqb9AKFuFOi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2023-03-31T02:36:36.000Z","Image","https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqb9AKFuFOi/",,,,

,"There’s basketball, a zen room and pool tables, but with the addition of a listening ear from youth workers it’s hoped a new Hamilton Youth Hub will help keep teens “away from the bad track” of ramraids and other trouble.

Kimi Manaakitanga is expected to cost close to $1m, including for the specialist youth-oriented team, and is partly funded through Hamilton City Council and Government funding.

It’s the brainchild of Kirikiriroa Family Services Trust (KFST) and rangatahi helped develop the centre, which it’s hoped will help stop antisocial behaviour and vulnerable children being pushed into committing crimes such as ramraids.

,"Ramadan – the most blessed month of the Islamic calendar – is an important period of fasting, prayer and reflection.

As this year's Ramadan period draws to a close, five New Zealand Muslims share their experiences and their plans for celebrating Eid al-Fitr – the festival of breaking the fast.

""We are really grateful that we are in New Zealand, where the climate conditions are quite in favour of Ramadan when compared to other countries. I was born in India, and in the climate over there, you get way too easily tired."" - Noor Mohammed Shaikh

""I'm very lucky because my manager's quite accommodating and she lets me leave early sometimes to go and break my fast with my family. But I know it's not the case with a lot of people. I've got friends who break their fast in the back room of a shop or something just quickly, and then they go back to work."" - Rand Abueideh

""I think Ramadan is always hard for me because my parents and extended family aren't around - they're mostly in the UK. Ramadan's always nicer when you are sharing it with your family, and Eid (the celebration at the end of Ramadan) will be the same. It's always hard doing religious festivals on your own."" - Ashia Ismail-Singer

""There was a competition I was supposed to go to in Auckland for athletics, but I had to pull out because I didn't have any energy to be able to run and compete on the day. It was a little bit disappointing, but I'd rather take care of myself than push my body over its limit. And my coaches all understand what Ramadan is and how it has an effect on your body."" - Aysha Hussan

""Personally, and for all Muslims, Ramadan is a great opportunity to reflect, to practice self-control and self-discipline and restraint, which is pretty much your ability to control your emotions and action and desires. That's the whole purpose of Ramadan, to not take anything for granted; to start to appreciate little things, as simple as a cup of water or a banana."" - Abdelhalim (Halim) Hassouna

,"Multiple people are dead and several have been injured after a large fire broke out at a Wellington hostel this morning.

Fire and Emergency has confirmed there are multiple fatalities and say they are expecting that number to rise.

Crews were alerted at 12.25am to the fire at Loafers Lodge on Adelaide Road in Newtown.

Police said their initial assessment was that the number of deaths was fewer than 10, but they could not be any more specific at this point.

The building was unsafe, and until they could enter and reconcile numbers of people who were safe they were not in a position to determine how many people were deceased or unaccounted for.

They asked people to come forward if they, or someone they know, had been staying at the property.

Prime Minister Chris Hipkins says New Zealanders have woken up to the tragic news.

""I want to extend my condolences to those who have lost their lives and their families.
