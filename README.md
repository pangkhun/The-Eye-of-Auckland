# The-Eye-of-Auckland

In a world with a steady rise of danger and crime in urban areas, people are becoming increasingly concerned about their safety and well-being. 

The Eye of Auckland is a project that aims to remind the general population to keep away from dangerous incidents. Data of dangerous incidents that occured around Auckland city is sourced from a variety of data sources such as popular social media platforms (eg. Twitter and Instagram) and also governmental databases such as the dynamic police database. The data is processed and unified into a clean standardised dataset and calculates the frequency of events in a chronological order. 

These results can be used with a schedular to refresh periodically and displayed on a googlemaps visualisation where it is filterable by incident type, show the incidents as a list and show all the information about the incidents that occurred.
